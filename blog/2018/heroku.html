		<h1>Deploying Java EE 8 Applications to Heroku</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="postingdate"><em>01 November 2018</em></p>

	<p><div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am currently developing a simple web-app that is most-likely only used by myself and maybe some friends.
It is using Java EE 8 and also has a HTML/JavaScript UI that gives me the possibility to tinker with some modern browser-APIs like WebComponents, Shadow-DOM, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I like to leverage such hobby-projects to also try and learn new stuff, I was looking for a simple (and cheap) way to host this application in the cloud.
Obviously, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud would be options if my focus would be on learning something new with these cloud platforms.
But this time I wanted to focus on the actual application and thus use something slightly more developer-friendly.
In this post I will show how to deploy a Java EE 8 application on <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> using TomEE and OpenLiberty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As there are not many references on the internet that describe how to deploy Java EE applications on Heroku (specifically not an application-server-based deployment), I think this write-up might also be helpful to others.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_procfile_and_fat_jar_solutions">Procfile and Fat Jar Solutions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From past experience I know that Heroku makes it simple to deploy to the cloud. It integrates nicely with Git and deploying can be as simple as typing <code>git push heroku master</code>. Literally.
Basically, you define a <code>Procfile</code> that tells heroku how to build and deploy the application. If I would want to use a fat-jar solution like PayaraMicro, Thorntail or just repackaging as a fat-jar, this would work easily. Heroku will detect popular build-systems like Maven and Gradle, build the application and the <code>Procfile</code> just needs to contain the command-line to run the Jar. See <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-java">here</a> for the steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not an option for me as I want to do the main development on a regular application-server; deploying to production with a different model then what is used in development does not sound like a great idea. Why do the main development on a regular application-server? Because the build is much fast than when it needs to download and package a 50 MB Jar-file.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_docker_container_registry">Docker Container Registry</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Docker playes nicely with Java EE application-servers, the next logical step is to ask if you can somehow host a Docker container on Heroku.
And you can. They have a Docker conatainer registry where you can easily push images. Read the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime">steps</a> here.
The "downside" for me is that it does not have such a nice workflow as you are accustomed to from Heroku. Instead of doing <code>git push heroku master</code>, you now have to build locally or on some other build-server and then you basically do a <code>docker push</code>. This can easily lead to situations where you just start fiddling around and at one point and end with a deployed container that does not respresent a specific commit. I am not saying that this has to be a big problem for a hobby-project but why not aim for a better solution?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_docker_based_build_and_deploy_via_heroku_yml">Docker-based Build and Deploy via heroku.yml</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/docker-builds-heroku-yml">service</a> I finally opted for is still in public beta but promises to combine the easy workflow of <code>git push heroku master</code> with Docker.
The idea is to use Docker for building and deploying your application. A <code>heroku.yml</code> is used to define what images to build and what containers run.
The <code>heroku.yml</code> can look as simple as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code data-lang="yml">build:
  docker:
    web: Dockerfile</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>INFO: Note that you can find the whole project on <a href="https://github.com/38leinaD/heroku-javaee-starter">my GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This just means that during the build-stage an image named <code>web</code> will be built based on the <code>Dockerfile</code> in the root of the project. What command will be used to run it? By default, whatever is defined via <code>EXEC</code> in the <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How to set up the <code>Dockerfile</code>? As it is needed to build our application (via Gradle or Maven) <strong>and</strong> also deploy it, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">multi-stage builds</a> are the answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine as build
COPY . /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN ./gradlew build

FROM tomee:8-jre-8.0.0-M1-plume
COPY src/main/tomee/run_tomee.sh /usr/local/
COPY src/main/tomee/config/server.xml /usr/local/tomee/conf/
COPY --from=0 /usr/src/app/build/libs/heroku-javaee-starter.war /usr/local/tomee/webapps/
CMD /usr/local/run_tomee.sh</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first stage we use a plain OpenJDK-image to build our WAR-file with Gradle.
The second stage is based on an official TomEE base-image and additionally contains the WAR-file built in the first stage.
Note that we also package a dedicated shell-script to start TomEE; and the <code>server.xml</code> is mainly included to read the HTTP-port from an environment-variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Heroku works in the following way: When the container is started, an environment-variable named <code>PORT</code> is defined. It is the responsibility of the application to use this port.
For TomEE, I was only able to do this by taking the environment-variable in the Shell and then setting it as a Java system-property which is read in the <code>server.xml</code>. In contrast to this, OpenLiberty directly allows to access environment-variables in its configuration-file (which is coincidentally also called <code>server.xml</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will assume that you have a general understanding how to build a Java EE WAR-file with Gradle or Maven; there is nothing special here.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deploy_to_tomee_on_heroku">Deploy to TomEE on Heroku</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now lets see how we can get this deployed to Heroku.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create an account for Heroku, download/install the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Heroku CLI</a> and run <code>heroku login</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/38leinaD/heroku-javaee-starter">Heroku Java EE Starter Project</a> from my GitHub Repo.</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git clone https://github.com/38leinaD/heroku-javaee-starter.git
cd heroku-javaee-starter</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an application at Heroku and set the Stack so we can work with Docker and the <code>heroku.yml</code>.</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>heroku create
heroku stack:set container</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>And now the only step that you will need to repeat later during development; and it is the reason why it is so nice to work with Heroku in the first place:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git push heroku master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will push your code to Heroku and trigger the build and deployment of the application.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might remember from earlier that we gave the container the name <code>web</code> in the <code>heroku.yml</code>. By convention the container with this name is automatically scaled to one instance. If you would name the container differently (let`s assume <code>myapp</code>), you need to run <code>heroku ps:scale myapp=1</code> manually. Anyway, you can check with <code>heroku ps</code> what processes/containers are running for your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to see the actual stdout/log of the container starting up, you can use <code>heroku logs --tail</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the application-server is started, you can run <code>heroku open</code> and it will open the URL under which your application is deployed on Heroku in your default browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deploy_to_openliberty_on_heroku">Deploy to OpenLiberty on Heroku</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What changes are needed to deploy to a different application-server? E.g. OpenLiberty?
For one, a different <code>Dockerfile</code> that packages the WAR into an OpenLiberty container.
The reference which <code>Dockerfile</code> is used can be found in the <code>heroku.yml</code>.
You can simply change it to <code>Dockerfile.liberty</code> if you want to try it out.
As already stated before, the setting of the HTTP-port from an environment-varible can easily be done from OpenLiberty&#8217;s <code>server.xml</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To try it out, simply change the <code>heroku.yml</code> and run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git add heroku.yml
git commit -m "Deploy to OpenLiberty this time."
git push heroku master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can monitor the startup of OpenLiberty with <code>heroku logs --tail</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope it was possible for me to convience you that using Heroku for deploying Java EE application is an easy option for at least hobby-projects.
It only takes seconds to deploy an application and share it with family, friends or testers. :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The nice thing about integrating so nicely with Docker and Git, is that you don&#8217;t have a lot of proprietary content in your project. Except for the <code>heroku.yml</code> there is nothing. If your application grows, you can easily move to AWS or another cloud-provider.</p>
